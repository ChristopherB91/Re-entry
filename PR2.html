  <p>This is the part where jobs are listed hit the search button and a list of jobs will pop up. Unfortunatly the api I used had some copies and the description trailed off but it will be fixed in the near future. I also plan on using an input text to filter by location by taking the users input. I took multiple items from the object to display them directly. I chose these because I believed these were the most important pieces of information.</p>
  <button class="btn" id="Search" onclick="jobsearch()">Search</button>
<ul id = 'result'>
