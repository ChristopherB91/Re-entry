    <div id="description"><p>I do not know much about prison seeing as how I have never been nor do I know anybody, but I know that things are not in their favor. The first thought that comes to peoples mind is that they are convicts and have commited a crime so why should we care. We should care because many prisoners are disconnected from society and do not really have a way to re enter society and are on their own. I understand that they are convicts but we can not just leave them in the situation they are in and expect them to just come out of prison as a productive member of society. The following video below describes Jennifer Thomas and her experience in prison.</p></div>

    <div id=mypart><p>Knowing that prison reform is a vast field I decided to choose a section of the field and work from there. I had read that many ex felons go back into prison within the next five years and one of the reasons why is because they cannot find a job or they find a job and are rejected because they a former felon. It is unfortunate that people go into prison serve their time get out of prison with the idea to be a productive member of society and not go back to prison, just to find out they can't because of their past. That's where I want to help out, I want to create a way that the people who want a second chance have a place to go and earn it. The video below shows that a little help can go a long way.</p></div>
